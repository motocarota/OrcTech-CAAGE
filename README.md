##OrcTech CAAGE

CAAGE is a CAAT-based html5 game engine.

With this game engine you have a standard setup of classes to deal with

* Player
* Enemies
* Drop
* Spells
* Effects

For each of these class you can define a set of data to implement your own game with a defined structure.
It also features a component system to define common entities qualities for every actor in the game.
